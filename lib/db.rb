    # What kind of thing is getting printed out to the console?
    # How would you find out?
    # How do you know what order the fields are returned in
    # when you do SELECT * FROM rather than, e.g., SELECT id, name FROM?
    #
    # Now consider:
    #   results = @database.execute("SELECT * FROM some_table")
    #   results.each do |result|
    #     puts result['name']

    # Do you ever actually care what "order" the database returns the fields in,

  # See http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/BasicObject.html#method-i-method_missing
  # If an object defines method_missing, Ruby will call it
  # as a "measure of last resort" if the method is otherwise undefined
  #
  # This is hard to wrap your head around unless you think of 
  # method calls as messages, and objects as recipients of those messages.
  #
  # "methods" are then like mailboxes.  If you define SomeClass#foo, then 
  # every time you call SomeClass.new.foo the message gets sent to 
  # the "def foo(...);end" mailbox
  #
  # method_missing says, "If nothing else wants to deal with this message, I will"
  # like some kind of lost and found
  #
  # See also http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Object.html#method-i-send
  # for how Object#send works
